# Becca Lee Bae: Portfolio Site

This is the latest version of my portfolio site built with React. The site is essentially made up of two pages:

- A home page with a brief bio and grid of project icons
- A dynamically generated project page with client information, tech used, wireframes and mockups.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React")
- [React-Router-Dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/ "React-Router-Dom")
