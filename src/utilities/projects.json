      "FMeasure is a B2B web application offering detailed insights for both potential investors and startups searching for funding. For this project, I was the sole UX designer and front-end engineer. I began with a deep dive of the information architecture pertaining to the legacy application and eventually pared down the introductory number of products to three. I then shifted my focus to designing the onboarding and main user flows, which helped me decide which reusable components to create. Over the course of 8 weeks, I developed the new web application with the help of React and the Ant Design library, the latter for data entry elements and a responsive table offering filtering, sorting, and pagination features.",

      "Toreador Films is a film production company based in Brooklyn, NY. The founder, Alexandre Pulido, was looking to move the companyâ€™s website off of Squarespace in search of a customized digital experience for potential clients and general visitors. In order to give users a more fully-featured concept of Toreador Films, I opted for a minimalist UI/UX design with a focus on the visual content. I began by reorganizing the information architecture of the existing site and built hi-fidelity wireframes to communicate the new user flow. Once the design decisions were finalized, I began the front-end development using React and built a custom CMS using Ruby on Rails and ActiveAdmin.",

      "As the sole front-end engineer of Hello Vera (a customer service AI startup), I took ownership of redesigning and developing the client-facing console. The previous console offered many useful AI management features for clients, but the UI and UX was not clear enough for them to take full advantage of these tools. Utilizing the feedback from meetings with clients, I redesigned the user flow for the entire console, making toggling between and managing different channels much easier. Throughout the redesign process, I designed and developed a new navigation, self-service onboarding, a multi-channel dashboard, several analytics pages, and knowledgebase import tools.",
