            "Toreador Films is a film production company based in Brooklyn, NY. The founder, Alexandre Pulido, was looking to move the companyâ€™s website off of Squarespace in search of a customized digital experience for potential clients and general visitors. In order to give users a more fully-featured concept of Toreador Films, I opted for a minimalist UI/UX design with a focus on visual and text content. I began by reorganizing the information architecture of the existing site and built hi-fidelity wireframes to communicate the new user flow. Once the design decisions were finalized, I began the front-end development using React and built a custom CMS using Ruby on Rails and ActiveAdmin.",

The previous console offered many useful AI management features for clients, but the UI and UX was not clear enough for them to take full advantage of these tools. Utilizing the feedback from meetings with clients, I redesigned the user flow for the entire console, making toggling between and managing different channels much easier. Throughout the redesign process, I designed and developed a new navigation, self-service on-boarding, a multi-channel dashboard, analytics pages, and knowledge base import tools.",
